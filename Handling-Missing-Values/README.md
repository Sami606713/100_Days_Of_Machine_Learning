# Handling Missing Values

## Complete Case Analysis

Complete Case Analysis (CCA) involves removing all rows that contain missing values from a dataset.

- In Complete Case Analysis, we can remove all rows that contain missing values.

- CCA is applicable when we are confident that missing data is completely at random (MCAR).

- Generally, we can remove values if they are missing less than 5%.

## Remember Before Applying CCA

Before removing and after removing, the distribution of data should be the same or almost the same.
